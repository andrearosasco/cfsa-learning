## Test the comparisons

I will try to clone the repositories and use them without any modification. If, for any reason, this will turn out not 
to be possible I'll fork the repository. You can find the link to the code for each comparison in the table below. 


| Comparison     |               Repo                |                                   Commit |

Outside each cloned repository there is a Dockerfile to generate an image where the project can be run and a demo.py 
that reads images from the webcam with opencv, run the model and show the results in real-time.
